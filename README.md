# Introduction to Practical Machine Learning

This is a short introduction to what machine learning is and how it can be
used in practice.

## Target Audience

The target audience is software engineers with no experience in machine
learning.

## Goals

1. Conceptual understanding of machine learning so that you can identify
   what problems would be usefully addressed by machine learning.
2. Understanding of the core concepts and terminology in machine learning.
3. Solve a practical machine learning problem that can be used in a web
   application.

## What is machine learning?

> Any computer program that improves its performance at some task through
experience.

[Mitchell][1] p.2

> There is a target to be learned. It is unknown to us. We have a set of
examples generated by the target. The learning algorithm uses these examples
to look for a hypthesis that approximates the target.

### Supervised learning

We have a set of `training examples` with known inputs `x` and outputs `y`.

We learn a `hypothesis function` `f` mapping inputs to ouputs:

```
f: x -> y 
```

Given an unseen example we apply `f` to it and output our prediction.

Examples of supervised learning include:

* character recognition: `training example` inputs are images of characters
  and outputs are letters in an alphabet
* email spam classification: `training example` inputs are emails and outputs
  are boolean values representing "is spam" or "is not spam"

### Unsupervised learning

In unsupervised learning we do not have outputs. However, we still have
information about our training examples and can use that to group them,
sort them, cargeorize them, etc.

Examples of unsupervised learning include:

* PageRank: search results are ordered using the graph connecting each result
* Categorizing buildings: if we know how many rooms and floors we can build
  clusters based on that and determine if it is an apartment or a house.

### Semi-supervised learning

In semi-supervised learning we do not know the output of some of our
`training examples`.

For example, we may ask specialists to evaluate a small sample of our dataset
and assign labels to each sample. Then we use machine learning to apply these
labels to the rest of the data.

## More Examples

Is this task supervised, or unsupervised, or more than one type?

1. Recommending a book to a user in an online bookstore
2. Playing tic-tac-toe
3. Categorizing movies into different types
4. Learning to play music
5. Credit limit: deciding the maximum allowed debt for each bank customer
